# Python-BBBlackjack

The current release of this Python-based blackjack game is designed for lightweights:  single-player (plus dealer), no additional options such as 'double-down' or 'insurance', bets ranging from only $5-20, and a starting balance of just $50. 
We're playing with a single deck, but you'll be able to play a dozen or so rounds without interruption before we have to start a new shuffled deck.  Also, at the end of each round you'll get an option to retrieve a history of all your hands, bets and available betting balances compiled during your current playing session.
